# Computational_Montecarlo
Final project for computational physics class. It consistis in using Montecarlo algorithms to calculate the volume of spheres in any given dimension.
It has an additional code for computing values of the gamma function as a way of comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm in different scenarios. 
The report was made in collaboration with the team.
My main contribution was designing, writing and implementing the algorithms used.
